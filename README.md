# The Alioth Desktop Environment

# Introduction
The Alioth Desktop Environment is a WIP window manager that is focused on functionality, efficiency and appearance. Besides, it will just work without stupid problems, like blurred XWayland windows when fractional scaling is enabled.

# Status
Currently it is in a very early stage of development - it even hasn't taken shape. This means no adoptions will be encouraged.
